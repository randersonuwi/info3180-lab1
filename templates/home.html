      <p>Step 5 - Deploy the application to Heroku
Now deploy your application to Heroku. If you haven't already done so, ensure that you
sign up for an account on the Heroku website (https://heroku.com) and then do the
following. Note: You will also need the Heroku CLI. This should already be installed on
Cloud9. If you are instead working on your local machine, then you must install the CLI
tool. See instructions at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli .</p>
